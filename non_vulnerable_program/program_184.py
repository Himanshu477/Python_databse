For database spam, spam.dir contains the index (a text file),
spam.bak *may* contain a backup of the index (also a text file),
while spam.dat contains the data (a binary file).

XXX TO DO:

- seems to contain a bug when updating...

- reclaim free space (currently, space once occupied by deleted or expanded
items is never reused)

- support concurrent access (currently, if two processes take turns making
updates, they can mess up the index)

- support efficient access to large databases (currently, the whole index
is read when the database is opened, and some updates rewrite the whole index)

- support opening for read-only (flag = 'm')
